# SYSU-30k
SYSU-30k Dataset of "Weakly Supervised Person Re-ID: Differentiable Graphical Learning and A New Benchmark" https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03845


## Statistic of the dataset

 SYSU-30k contains 30k categories of persons, which is about 20 times large rthan CUHK03 (1.3k categories)and Market1501 (1.5k categories), and 30 times larger than ImageNet (1k categories). SYSU-30k contains 29,606,918 images. Moreover, SYSU-30k provides not only a large platform for the weakly supervised ReID problem but also a more challenging test set that is consistent with the realistic setting for standard evaluation. Figure 1 shows some samples from the SYSU-30k dataset.

## Download the dataset

Note that our original training set occupies 462G's memory. We are not able to upload the original data taking up such a large memory. As a result, we downsample the train images from 288 * x resolution to 144 * x resolution with x representing the shortest edge. The compressed data sum up to 100+G.

The test set is uncompressed due to the appropriate memory size.
